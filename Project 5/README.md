# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Availe**

Time spent: **3.5** hours spent in total

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

Added the following queries: nparams["hd"] = "true", params["date"] = date, params["api_key"] = "placeholder"

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API**.

## Notes

- I learned that Kotlin also has extensions like how Swift does, which allowed me to add a new functionality to the Calendar class
- I learned that you can leave a textView or imageView empty when you initialize a project
- I learned how to use Postman to inspect a JSON query
